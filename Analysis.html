		<h3> 
			We have interviewed 4 people out which three personas were mentioned below.
		</h3>
			<ul class="b">
			<li> Persona's help us to easily represent users in general.</li>
			<li>They help in understanding user needs and help in understanding the negetive aspects in website. </li>
			<li>From the Inputs it is observed that the users may find it difficult to navigate and find their requirement.</li>
			<li>To compensate that we need to create navigation bar of some kind.</li>
			<li>Also, it is tough to monitor student activity with groups and individual collaborations.</li>
			<li>This can be avoided by image and code tracking done through the website.</li>
			<li>Too much of interface concentration can mislead and may not provide the required platform to community.</li>
			<li>This need to be watched as the main motive of the website depends on this.</li>
			<li>This can be avoided by constant review and feedback from users.</li>
