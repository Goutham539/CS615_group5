            <h2>Paper prototyping and User Analysis</h2>
            <p> We have created the following paper prototype based on the task analysis we created previously.</p>
          
            <h2>1. Basic Paper prototype</h2>
            <p> It is the process where UI design team create paper representations of digital products to help them realize concepts and test designs.<br> They are used to test ideas, focus on important points, helps in improving design ideas.  </p>
