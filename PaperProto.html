            <h2>Paper prototyping and User Analysis</h2>
            <p> We have created the following paper prototype based on the task analysis we created previously.</p>
          
            <h2>1. Basic Paper prototype</h2>
            <p> It is the process where UI design team create paper representations of digital products to help them realize concepts and test designs.<br> They are used to test ideas, focus on important points, helps in improving design ideas.  </p>

            <ul class="a"><li>User analysis of the prototype</li></ul>
            <h3>User-1(Kanthiraj)</h3>
            <p> pros:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> The interface felt lively and easy to work.</li>
                <li> options were eleaborated. </li>
                <li> Structured User interface. </li>

                <li> Structured User interface. </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Flaws on this prototype</h3>
            <h2>2. Finalized Model</h2>
            <p> Based on the above flaws and user reviews, We have come up with this finalized model. </p>
            <p> This is the final model we came up with</p>
            <p> This prototype is based on the task analysis we came up with. </p>
