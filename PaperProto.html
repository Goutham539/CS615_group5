            <h2>Paper prototyping and User Analysis</h2>
            <h4> We have created the following paper prototype based on the task analysis we created previously.</h4>
          
            <h2>1. Basic Paper prototype</h2>
            <ul class="b">
                <li>It is the process where UI design team create paper representations of digital products to help them realize concepts and test designs.</li>
                <li>They are used to test ideas, focus on important points, helps in improving design ideas.</li>
            </div>
            <div class = "photo_center">
            <img class="pp1" src="ProtoPhoto1.jpeg" alt="Initial Paper Phototype">
            <p> Fig: Initial prototype proposed. </p>
            </div>
            <div class = "Prototype1">
           <h2>2. Running the tests</h2>
           <p> We have used the following briefing to let user know about the website.</p>
           <div class = "photo_center">
               <img class="pp1" src="UserBrief.png" alt="User briefing Pamplet">
               <p> Pamplet used to brief to users. </p>
                   </div>
            <h3>User-1</h3>
			<p> The user selected to be student and create group. At this point we were not
			sure about the options available in groups. But the options for students and professors
			was discussed and mentioned.</p>
            <p> pros:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> The interface felt lively and easy to work.</li>
                <li> options were eleaborated. </li>
                <li> Structured User interface. </li>
            </ul>
            <p> cons: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Found the menu very limited. - There is no options like quick links or consistancy in options needed.  </li>
                <li> Not categorized. - <p>e.g:User felt the tests to be a seperate column and let professor decide on asiignment of groups. Also, he felt navigation to different tabs tough to understand.</p> </li>
            </ul><br>
            <h3>User-2</h3>
            <p> Notes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> UI feels smooth. </li>
                <li> Clear and task oriented. </li>
            </ul>
            <p> cons: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Mentioned to categorise groups into subgroups to make hierarchical.
			<p> - User wanted to make groups distinguishable as student and teacher and topic related.</p>
				</li>
                <li> Did not understand how groups and tests are linked. <p> - User felt there must be either a seperate tests dock and groups and professors must be able to use them.  </p> </li>
            </ul><br>
            <h3>User-3</h3>
            <p> Notes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Liked the options available for professor. </li>
                <li> Was able to understand all the options available. </li>
            </ul>
            <p> cons: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Did not get hang of menu and dashboard difference. </li>
            </ul><br>
            <h3>Flaws of this prototype</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> This UI doesn't have a lot of options. <p>- User suggested us to make seperate options for login of professor and student.</p> </li>
                <li> UI seems to be premature. <p> User mentioned the UI as underdeveloped. </p> </li>
                <li> The navigation is confusive and not clear. <p></p></li>
                <li> Groups, users, and meetings tasks are not divided properly.  </li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>3. Finalized Model</h2>
            <ul class="b">
            <li> Based on the above flaws and user reviews, We have come up with this finalized model. </li>
            <li> This prototype is based on the task analysis we came up with. </li>
            <li> This is the final model we came up with:</li><br>
            </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="photo_center">
            <img class="pp1" src="ProtoPhoto2.jpeg" alt="Final Paper Phototype task-1">
                <p> Task-1: Student accessing all the options available to him. </p>

                <p> Task-2: Professor accessing and conducting classes on Umass Coop.</p>

                <p> Task-3: Professor conducting a meeting to collaborate.</p>
            <img class="pp1" src="MenuClip.png" alt="Menu options">
                <p> These options are provided to the user to navigate through the website easily.</p>
            <h2>4. Observations </h2>
            </div>
            <div class = "Prototype1">
            <p> We have asked users for following options</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Check scores of an exam(provided the subject code).</li>
                <li> Conduct a meeting. </li>
                <li> Post a question on discussion board. </li>
                <li> Chat with fellow student. </li>
                <li> Create a test for your class. </li>
                <li> Create a group for your project. </li>
            </ul><br>
            <p> It is also observed that the users are confused on how we decided on the tests to have group option.<br>whereas all the users we asked wanted to have test option embedded in the group page.</p>
