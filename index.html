Problem Statement:

Viewability of FICO score
Though there are various options available still there are some banks whose websites are tough to access.
Soft check and hard check difference.
Visibility of Credit card issues
Autopay Subscriptions UI
Fraudulent transaction guesses.
Limit visibility - Boring old number system ( we can use colors etc to make it look good).
Loan details
Fetch FICO score and mention availability of loan amount.
Provide soft check and hard check estimates.(approximations window)
Monthly categorization of expenses.
New deals notifications.(silent push notifications)
