            <h2>Paper prototyping and User Analysis</h2>
            <h4> We have created the following paper prototype based on the task analysis we created previously.</h4>
          
            <h2>1. Basic Paper prototype</h2>
            <ul class="b">
                <li>It is the process where UI design team create paper representations of digital products to help them realize concepts and test designs.</li>
                <li>They are used to test ideas, focus on important points, helps in improving design ideas.</li>
