			<h2> Version - 1 </h2>
			<p> The sketches-1 had a minimal UI explaining all the basic components that explains the task.
			Though this sketches explain tasks that are mentioned in the storyboard, they are not visually appealing.
			So, to make them more appealing more functions and representations were needed. In the task-3 the design 
			was irrelevant as it was Partially mobile interface and Partially desktop View. </p>
			
			<h2> Version - 2 </h2>
			<p> The sketches-2 has better detail and UI showing many options and has viewable UI. 
			 It shows easy navigation to users. Users can move through various sections easily using menu options.
			 Also the backward slides goes to previous page and so on. This way this version is more visible and 
			 displays all the options available to user at a single place.</p>
			 
			 <p> We have selected version-2 as this shows the flow and almost all options mentioned by task analysis.
			 Next the task-2 was elaborative and shows many options compared to version-1.
