				<p>Facing difficulties collaborating with fellow classmates?</p>    
				<p>Students during their studies in the university miss a class like environment. They like to develop skills through interacting with fellow students by making teams, groups and study batches.</p>
				<p> During this time all people want things to be online and get things done from home. This platform provides oppurtunity to get all the things together at one place that makes this possible. </p>

				<h2>Details</h2>
				<h4>Currently the existing websites like Piazza, Stack Overflow etc.<br> helps students to get clarify their doubts (Though not in a timely manner). <br> It does not enable the students in continuous study.</h4>
					Some of the things that lack in these websites are:<br>
				<ul>
					<li>Interaction with other fellow students.</li>
					<li>Students can't have any social connectivity with other students.</li>
					<li>Collectively study and progress in a domain.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4> Users can: </h4>
				<ul class="b">
					<li> Login using their UMB mail id and join groups. </li>
					<li> They can post their doubts in discussion forms. </li>
					<li>Students can find people to team up and make some small time projects.</li>
					<li> Search for people with similar interests or topics helps in interaction. </li>

		<h3> My Umass Coop </h3>
		<ul>
			<li> Students and teachers can login using their college mail id. </li>
			<li> After signing up users can find their dashboard with various options to navigate through website. </li>
			<li> Students can join/create groups to interact with other students or join their classes and professors will be made admin to class groups. </li>
			<li> Discussion forms lead to various types of discussion students or teachers post and follow ups can be done. </li>
			<li> Using Meetings tab professor can conduct a meeting (take class online) and share screen and do a lot of other stuff. </li> 
			<li> Student can get their grades and professors can view cumulative grades of all students in class through groups. </li>
		</ul>

		<div class = "Analysis">
			<h2>Step-2: Analysis</h2>
			<p> In this step we have done user analysis of three random users and made templates. 
			Then we have done task analysis that consists of tasks our design will show. 
			Also, we have done Domain analysis with help of an ER-diagram. To see our Analysis step  <a href="Analysis.html" target="_blank">Click here.</a><p>

        <div class = "Sketches">
            <h2>Step-3: Story Board and Sketches</h2>
            <p> Story board in our case consists of story where a student Ben makes a project group using the website.
			Also, one other story where professor makes a group fo rhis class to discuss and conduct online classes.
			Then there are sketches that illustrate various tasks mentioned in Analysis stage. To view our Sketches <a href="Sketches.html" target="_blank">Click here.</a><p>

            <h2>Step-4: Paper prototypes and Testing</h2>

	<div class = "Sketches">
		<p> Paper prototype provide Abstract idea of what basic design features are going to be provided.
	This gives idea about our design interests and areas to concentrate on development. To view our paper prototype	<a href="PaperProto.html" target="_blank">Click here.</a><p>

        <div class = "Sketches">
            <h2>Computer Prototyping</h2>
            <p> We have provided a design using figma that shows 3 flows that explains each task. 
			This explains how tasks are completed. This helps in making actual prototype working. To view our prototype designs with respect to tasks <a href="ComputerProto.html" target="_blank">Click here.</a><p>

				<h3>Milestones</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Proposal and website construction</li>
					<li>Analysis and diagnosis </li>
					<li>Scenario and Stoyboard Designs </li>
					<li>Paper prototyping and low-fidelity testing </li>

					<h3> Problems faced: </h3>
					<ul class="a">
					<li> It is tough for users to find others with same interests. </li>
					<li> Integrating many options will make it tough to resolve any issue faced. </li>
					<li> Users may find confusing with options available. </li>
					<li> Handling the profiles and huge data may be an issue. </li>
					<li> Cross-Platform integration makes users tough to interact. </li>
