            <h2>Problem Statement:</h2><br>
            <div>
                Students during their studies in the university miss a class like environment. They like to develop skills through interacting with fellow students by making teams, groups and study batches.

            <ul>
                <li>Currently the existing websites like Piazza, Stack Overflow etc. helps students to get clarify their doubts (Though not in a timely manner).  It does not enable the students in continuous study.</li><br>
            
            <li>Some of the things that lack in these websites are:<br></li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                Interaction with other fellow students.
                </li>
                <li>
                   Students canâ€™t find people to team up and make some small time projects.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Collectively study and progress in a domain.
                </li>
                
            </ul>
            
            <li>We can make people to interview each other making groups to make them ready to real world interviews.</li><br>
